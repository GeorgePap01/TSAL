TSAL is a safety system.
When the voltage at the vehicle side of the Accumulator Isolation Relays is lower than 60V and the Isolation and Precharge Relays are open, it opens a green light.
When the voltage at the DC Link capacitor is higher than 60V, it opens a red light.
Another function of the system is to detect a broken wire that carries a signal which affects the functionality of the system or when a relay is stucked (Compares the intenional and the mechanical stayte of the relay)
